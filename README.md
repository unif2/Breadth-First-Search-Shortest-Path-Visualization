# Visualization of the Breadth First Search Algorithm to Find the Shortest Path Between Two Nodes in a Graph

C++ program that graphically (and interactively) shows how the Breadth First Search algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

Demonstration: https://youtu.be/5t9vB8OI1p4

Tools/Languages/Libraries: C++ compiled with g++ version 12.2.0, and the SFML graphics library (specifically, the “Graphics.hpp” file). For building the executable, I used GNU Make version 4.2.1.
