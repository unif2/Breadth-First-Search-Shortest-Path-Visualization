# Breadth-First-Search-Shortest-Path-Visualization

C++ program graphically (and interactively) showing how the Breadth First Search algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

Tools/Languages/Libraries: C++ compiled with g++ version 12.2.0, and the SFML graphics library (specifically, the “Graphics.hpp” file).  For building the executable, I used GNU Make version 4.2.1.
